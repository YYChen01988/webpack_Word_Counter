Homework: WordCounter
Learning Objectives
Be able to install and configure webpack in an application
Be able to implement the pub/sub pattern in a front-end JavaScript application
Brief
Your task is to create a word counter application that allows a user to submit some text, and see how many words they entered displayed below.

Use the pub/sub pattern to create modular views, with a model that handles the business logic. You should use the start point, which has the HTML already provided.

Use webpack to bundle your JavaScript files.

MVP
A user should be able to enter text into the text area, submit it and see the number of words that they entered, displayed below.
Planning
You will need to set-up webpack in your application:

Initialise npm - npm init

Install 'webpack' and 'webpack-cli' - npm install -D webpack webpack-cli

Create a webpack config file - webpack.config.js

Add the configuration details(copy paste from previous file but make sure related js files in the src folder) to the config file

Add a script to the package.json to run webpack in watch mode - "build": "webpack -w"

Add a script tag to link to the bundled file in the HTML - <script type="text/javascript" src="js/bundle.js"></script>

Run webpack - npm run build

Check the log that shows the JavaScript has loaded is showing in the browser console.

Add bundle.js to a .gitignore file
